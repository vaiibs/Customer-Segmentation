# Customer-Segmentation

Objective :

Developed a customer segmentation to give recommendations like saving plans, loans, wealth management, etc. on target customer groups.

K-Means is a Unsupervied Machine Learning technique used to group similar data points into K clusters. It works by assigning each point to the nearest group center, called a centroid, and then adjusting these centers to better fit the data. This process repeats until the groups donâ€™t change much, helping you find patterns or structure in your data.

Used the Elbow Method technique to help determine the optimal number of clusters (K) for a dataset
